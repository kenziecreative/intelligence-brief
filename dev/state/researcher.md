# Stream: researcher

**Status:** live — **v1.11.0 released**. **v1.12.0 (W1) is built and fully swept at 3x
sampling: 18 of 19 goldens pass. Still UNTAGGED**, blocked on one scenario —
`adv-counter-evidence-valve` (Valve Honesty), which has failed four consecutive 3x rounds, 2 of
3 samples clean each time. A precise fifth fix is identified and is **a decision for Kelsey**,
not another quiet patch: see Next Steps 1.
**Worktree:** primary checkout (`core-kenzie-marketplace`) · branch `main`
**Last touched:** 2026-08-09

## Where it stands

**v1.11.0** — W2, the saturation → stop decision (Seam 1). Full history in
[researcher/CHANGELOG.md](../../researcher/CHANGELOG.md); the architecture map is
[dev/researcher/ARCHITECTURE.md](../researcher/ARCHITECTURE.md) (Seam 1 marked closed in the
same change). Design and the three resolved author forks:
[dev/researcher/w2-design.md](../researcher/w2-design.md).

Program-level view: `~/.claude/plans/shimmying-sauteeing-storm.md` (local, not in-repo). It now
carries a **plain-language legend for W1–W7** — written 2026-08-09 because the numbers are
discovery order and a second "Seam 0–5" scheme runs alongside them.

| Workstream | State |
|---|---|
| W7 — adversarial corpus review | **done**, v1.8.0 |
| /upskill constraint pass | **done**, v1.9.0 |
| W6a + W6b — completion integrity + cross-phase consistency | **done**, v1.10.0 |
| W2 — saturation → stop decision (Seam 1) | **done**, v1.11.0 (this session) |
| Eval harness debt | **closed** (this session) |
| **W1 — source-note fidelity (Seam 0)** | **built, v1.12.0 — partly verified** (see Next Steps) |
| W3 (next after W1), W4, W5, W6c–f | not started |

## Done this session

- **Eval harness debt closed** (`711c092` engine + `347c18e` pack). New `file_unchanged` gate
  type, `${PACK_ROOT}` so a pack ships its own `checks/`, an always-on capture-integrity layer,
  and three researcher gates: `state_cycle_coherent`, `state_unchanged_on_write_free`,
  `decision_ledger_unedited`. All three named blind spots now go red where they went green.
- **Evidence-Against golden** (`adv-evidence-against-routing`) + a Coverage Routing rubric
  dimension — chip `task_c631be46`, landed deliberately **before** W2.
- **W2 built and released as v1.11.0** (design `da43b9e`, build `9342cd9`, release `38ce0e8`,
  tagged `researcher-v1.11.0`).
- **Seven defects found and fixed** across eval iterations 24–29 — see CHANGELOG § Fixed.
- **`/eval-run` readout contract rewritten** (`06588dc`) after Kelsey flagged that eval readouts
  come back as unreadable machinery. Step 7 now requires behavior language.

## In flight / uncommitted

None. Tree clean, everything committed, tag applied.

## Next steps (in order)

1. **Decide `adv-counter-evidence-valve` — this is the only thing between v1.12.0 and a tag.**
   Four 3x rounds, each 2-of-3 clean, each failing one sample on the adverse-search summary.
   The defect changed character every round, which is the finding: rounds 1-3 were factual
   errors (miscounts; a null result called an affirmation; a supportive item called
   "no position"), round 4 is a judgment call about whether onboarding students onto an LMS is
   the same sense of "onboarding" as onboarding users onto a product. The judge called one of
   the three items "defensible" and disputed only the third.
   **The fix the four rounds revealed, which none of mine drew:** a disposition *name*
   legitimately covers its members — it is the log's own classification, true by construction —
   but a *reason* attached to that name does not, because reasons are per-item. Runs 1 and 3
   did exactly this and scored 3; run 2 appended a reason to the group and scored 2.
   Three options: (a) apply that fix and re-run 3x; (b) accept Valve Honesty 2 on this scenario
   with the reason recorded, which is weakening a golden and should be done deliberately if at
   all; (c) revisit whether the scenario's bar is over-tuned now that it turns on an arguable
   reading. Grounding: `eval/targets/researcher/_eval/iteration-38/scores.md` (local only).
2. **Tag `researcher-v1.12.0`** once step 1 resolves. Everything else is green at full sampling.
3. **`claim-graph.json` keeps pre-correction claim text after a fix is applied**, so the next
   pass's B12 regression sweep compares against text the draft no longer contains.
4. **Two `check-gaps` routing findings no gate covers**, both now confirmed across 3 samples:
   the run rolls STATE back from the seeded position, and sends the user to discovery while
   naming an unprocessed source already sitting in the candidates file. `state_cycle_coherent`
   passes both — internally consistent, wrong about the world.
5. **W3** (conclusion-vs-brief / significance, Seam 2), carrying the two vocabulary conflicts
   already logged against it.
6. **Init eval scenario** — `/research-init` still ships behaviorally unverified.

## Open questions / decisions pending

- **Kelsey's engine corpus has 8 open material findings** from the W7 live proof. Path:
  `/research-init upgrade` then `/research-review-corpus final` in that repo. Also the best
  real-world test of whether W6a/b's in-line checks would have caught what Codex caught by hand.
- Whether B13's four-element supersession route should sanction a **short-form second
  statement** — stating it in full for each reversal reads as a repeated template (No-Tics 2).

## Session knowledge worth keeping

- **The authoring lesson, now with three instances.** A requirement stated inside a branch does
  not bind the other branch; emphasis functions as exclusion. This session added two fresh cases
  *in wording written days after the lesson was recorded*: the stale-saturation disclosure sat
  inside a sentence about under-covered questions and never fired on the adequate branch; and the
  fix for it, added without a register constraint, defaulted to narrating file mechanics at the
  user — **because the mechanism is what the instruction was about.** When adding a disclosure
  requirement, state its register constraint in the same breath.
- **A ban fails when the banned thing is genuinely adjacent to a permitted thing.**
  Post-decision re-argument survived two fix attempts because a comparative restatement *is*
  forward-looking, so it read as the permitted "forward consequence." What closed it was a test,
  not more emphasis: *if a clause would still work as an argument for the other side, it is one* —
  plus a positional rule (name the override inside the forward sentence, append nothing).
- **3× sampling is load-bearing, demonstrated.** `adv-confirm-side-override` read green on one
  sample and failed on the pair. A single roll would have shipped a defect open since iteration 4.
  Five judges flagged their own single-sample verdicts as provisional, unprompted.
- **Prose-scanning integrity checks do not work.** The first capture-fidelity check scanned
  `capture.md` for file paths and red-flagged 25 of 41 real captures — a capture legitimately
  names plugin-root files it read and legitimately reports files that are *absent*. Prose cannot
  distinguish an invented artifact from a correctly-reported absence. Check machine-readable
  declarations (`artifacts_written`) instead: 0 false positives across 352 archived + 43 live.
- **`spoken.md` had never once been produced** in 23 iterations despite being mandatory in the
  runner spec, so the register/no-tics lints had nothing to read. The orchestrator now verifies
  the runner's four output files. It mattered immediately: two judges scored the user-facing turn
  from `spoken.md` and caught a `capture.md` claiming a behavior the turn contradicted.
- **Gates on *behavior* must not appear in `adapter.md`** — the runner reads that file, and a
  runner told cycle coherence is gated will tidy the checkboxes the skill forgot to tidy. They
  live in `coverage.md` (judge-only), with a line in the adapter telling maintainers the omission
  is deliberate. Rule recorded in `eval/reference/target-pack-spec.md`.
- **Eval dispatch cost:** shared briefs at `eval/targets/researcher/_eval/_briefs/{runner,judge}.md`
  cut each agent dispatch to two lines. Use them — the full inline brief costs ~400 tokens a call
  and a full run is dozens of calls.
- **Eval runs are local-only** (`eval/**/_eval/` is gitignored). Iterations 24–29 exist only in
  this checkout; the committed record is the CHANGELOG, `w2-design.md`, and this file.
- **Contract-hash sync rule** (unchanged): any edit to
  `researcher/reference/validate-corpus-review.py` requires regenerating
  `review-protocol-contract.json` from `hash-self`; it lives at `protocols.1.validator_sha256`,
  not a top-level key. Battery is 74/74 and ran green in this session's corpus scenarios.

## How to resume

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, then `dev/STATE.md` (index), then this file.
2. Read `~/.claude/plans/shimmying-sauteeing-storm.md` § Program status + the W1–W7 legend.
3. Start at Next Step 1 (merge + push), then take the W1-vs-W3 call.

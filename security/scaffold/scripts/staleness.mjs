/**
 * Review recency, from git. **The anti-skip mechanism.**
 *
 * ## What this replaces, and why
 *
 * The previous design's anti-skip mechanism was a denominator: every surface and store was
 * enumerated on every run, the set could only grow, and a surface no invariant claimed went
 * red. The premise was right — *nobody deletes a security gate, they add a route it doesn't
 * cover* — but the implementation had to be complete or it lied, and regex over arbitrary
 * source is never complete. Two reviews found the same defect repeatedly.
 *
 * This is the honest version of the same idea, and it needs no denominator at all:
 *
 *   **You changed code nobody looked at.**
 *
 * That is decidable from git with certainty. It does not require knowing what a file
 * contains, what framework it uses, or whether a guard is present. It requires only two
 * facts, both of which are exact: when a path was last reviewed, and what has happened to it
 * since. A file nobody has ever reviewed is the strongest signal available here, and it costs
 * nothing to compute.
 *
 * The corollary that matters more than the headline: **a clean run over a subsystem nobody
 * reviewed is not a clean subsystem.** Without this file the reviewer's output would be
 * indistinguishable from a thorough one, which is the "absence of findings is not evidence of
 * security" failure made concrete.
 *
 * ## State
 *
 * `security/.state/reviews.json` — written by /security:review and /security:sweep, one
 * record per reviewed path:
 *
 *   { "path": "src/http", "commit": "0df83b4", "date": "2026-07-26", "lens": ["injection"] }
 *
 * Nothing here writes it. This file only reads and reports.
 *
 *   node security/scripts/staleness.mjs           human-readable
 *   node security/scripts/staleness.mjs --json    for an agent or the gate
 *
 * Zero dependencies. Never touches a network.

/**
 * The gate. **It enforces only what a script can decide.**
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * The previous version of this file tried to gate on *analysis*: it enumerated surfaces,
 * matched guard patterns against handler paths, and reported "N of M invariants hold over M
 * surfaces." Two external reviews concluded it was not trustworthy, and the root cause was
 * never a bug — it was the claim. A script cannot establish that code is authorized, and one
 * that says it can is worse than nothing, because it converts an open question into a false
 * answer.
 *
 * So this file makes no claim about the code at all. It reads the findings registry, the
 * deterministic scanners, and git, and it blocks on facts that are exactly decidable:
 *
 *   1. An unresolved finding at or above the configured severity.
 *   2. An accepted risk whose expiry passed, or whose file changed since it was accepted.
 *   3. A credential candidate in staged content, in a path with no benign label.
 *   4. A registry that has been edited to make a red finding disappear.
 *   5. A registry with no findings AND no review history — which is not a clean repository,
 *      it is an unexamined one.
 *
 * Whether a vulnerability exists is the reviewer's job, and the reviewer is an agent. That
 * division is stated in the README rather than papered over: **the analysis needs an agent;
 * this only holds the line on what the analysis already found.**
 *
 * Runs two ways, one implementation:
 *
 *   node security/scripts/check.mjs            standalone; exit 1 on fail
 *   node security/scripts/check.mjs --json     read-only, writes nothing
 *
 * and as a trailhead check module via `run(context)`.
 *
 * Zero dependencies. Never touches a network.

  // anything having traced a sink. A gate that judges is the thing this design says a gate

  // `sk_live_…`, `ghp_…`, a PEM header — does not occur by accident, so it is blockable
  // wherever it appears; a real key committed into a fixture directory is still a real key
  // and still has to be rotated. A credential-SHAPED ASSIGNMENT is not decidable by format
  // at all: `password = "hunter2"` is a fixture, a sample, or a live credential, and only
  // reading the origin and the sink separates them. That one goes to the reviewer as a
  // candidate and never blocks a commit.

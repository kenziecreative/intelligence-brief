# PreToolUse gate for the researcher plugin.

# Blocks Write/Edit/MultiEdit operations targeting ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/research/outputs/
# unless authorized by a recent (within 120s) "pass" entry in
# ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/research/audits/gate-log.md. /research-audit-claims
# writes that entry immediately before promoting a draft, so legitimate
# promotions flow through; rogue writes (manual edits, other skills) bounce.
#
# Output contract: exit 0 always; emit JSON decision on stdout per Claude Code
# PreToolUse hook spec. {"decision":"block","reason":"..."} blocks the tool call
# and surfaces reason to the user; absence of decision allows the call.

Draft a research output section from processed source notes.

Use the `research-summarize-section` skill and follow its steps exactly. It pulls claims and evidence from processed sources relevant to the requested section, drafts the synthesis under `research/drafts/`, and prepares it for the `/research-audit-claims` gate before promotion to `research/outputs/`.
